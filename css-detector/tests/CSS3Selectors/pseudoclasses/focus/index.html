		<h1>HTML5 Methods for Making Things Tab-able</h1>

		<p>Taken from <a>https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/f/focus/</a>. All items should be clickable.</p>

		<p>All of the items below are tabbable. The text area and button are tabbable by default, and the divs use two different methods.</p>

		<input type="text"/>
		<textarea tabindex="1">A textarea. Focus states work by default.</textarea>
		<button tabindex="2">And I'm a button. Again, works by default.</button>
		<div contenteditable tabindex="3">Divs don't usually have a focus state. But I'm special, because I'm <code>contenteditable</code>.</div>
		<div tabindex="4">I'm another div, and I have a <code>tabindex</code>. You can't edit me like the div above, but you can tab to me.</div>
		<textarea tabindex="-1">I can't be tabbed to. This is a terrible idea, generally, but it can be done using tabindex="-1". Notice that (if you click) I still have a focus state, even though you can't tab to me.</textarea>
