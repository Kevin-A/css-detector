# stylesheet order

There are four ways to include css stylesheets:

1. In an elements `style` attribute,
2. In the `<style></style>` tags in the `<head>` of the document
3. Using @import rules in a stylesheet
4. Using the `<link>` element to reference an external .css file

This basic website was used to verify the priorities of loading these files.
